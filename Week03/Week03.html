            One thing Bush's article made me question was:"How did human memory and human information get this far when technology was much less advanced than it was now?" <br>
            As Bush's article states that we as people are horrible at consulting the information that we have collected, how would advanced technology change our society <br>
            for the better? Bush's article states that the future would allow information to be stored much easily but would storing information allow people to use it <br> 
            in a valuable way?

            After reading this article by Tim Berners-Lee, I immediately thought of privacy and how easily anyone's privacy could be accessed through the web. <br>
            Lee talks about how the web and internet are two completely different things, however, how trustworthy would open data on the web be? Security <br>
            across this platform is the most important aspect of being able to freely access the web.
