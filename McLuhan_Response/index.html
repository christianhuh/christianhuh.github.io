            McLuhan’s interpretation of the way the media changes people was impressive because of how it was predicted fifty years ago. <br>
             In McLuhan’s The Medium is the Massage,  the medium refers to the media and how we as humans deal with the information. <br>
             Consuming information in the 21st century has become completely different as information could be easily distributed. <br>
             People are able to connect with one another through these mediums on a much easier basis compared to the past. These mediums<br>
            have affected human interaction by turning conversations to emojis and having newspapers become replaced by social media.<br>
