            "To be <mark>naked</mark> is to be oneself. To be <mark>nude</mark> is to be <br>
             seen naked by others and yet not recognised for oneself." -Berger

        <p>
                Throughout Berger's text, this quote stuck out to me the <br>
            most because Berger puts the concept of vulnerabililty into <br>
            two different lightings. In this quote by Berger, the feeling of <br>
            nakedness refers to one's innate nature. When Berger refers to <br>
            being "nude", he talks about the physical aspect rather than the <br>
            metaphorical one. Its interesting to see how two similar words <br>
            could provide such different meanings. This quote reminds me of <br>
            two words that also seem similar but are significantly different: <br>
            normal and average. At first glance the words seem similar, however, <br>
            a normal human being and an average human being holds two different <br>
            meanings. Its amazing to see how even words themselves have a sense of <br>
            perception and how things are viewed.
